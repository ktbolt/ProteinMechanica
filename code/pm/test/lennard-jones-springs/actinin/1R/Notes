look at coarse-grain modeling of actinin
----------------------------------------

 look at models of single 1R domains.

 use Lennard-Jones springs.

 have four models:

   1) model1 - have springs btw all atoms

   2) model2 - have springs btw sidechain atoms, no backbone CA-C, etc.

   3) model3 - have springs btw sidechain atoms, and backbone CA-CA

   4) model4 - use md em min structure; potential same as model3. 



 1) run simulation 


    p model1=true run_sim.pmc

      max=14.443972


    p model2=true run_sim.pmc

      max=43.642761


    p model3=true run_sim.pmc

      max=37.702705


    p model4=true run_sim.pmc

      max=35.402157



 2) compare model1 and model2

    p model1=true model2=true run_sim.pmc


 3) compare model3 and model4

    em md energy minimization produces atom distances that are closer to their 
    equilibrium distance. this should produce a better approximation.

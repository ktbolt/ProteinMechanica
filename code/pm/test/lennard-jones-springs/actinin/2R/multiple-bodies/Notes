look at coarse-grain modeling of actinin
----------------------------------------

 look at models of single 1R domains.

 use Lennard-Jones springs.

 have two models:

     1) springs between all atoms


     2) springs between side chain atoms


     3) springs between c-alpha atoms


 1) run simulation 

    p model1=true run_sim.pmc 

    p model2=true run_sim.pmc 

    p model3=true run_sim.pmc 


 2) compare model1 and model2

    p model1=true model2=true run_sim.pmc

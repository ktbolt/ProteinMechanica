 # Program mrc2pm    #
 #-------------------#

 Electron density maps obtained from Cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) are 
 deposited at EMDataBank.org in the MRC file format. The data is a three-dimensional 
 grid of voxels each with a value corresponding to density of electrons.

 The mrc2pm program will read in a file in the MRC format and write out a 
 Protein Mechanica format .pm grid file. 


 Build
 -----
 gcc -o mrc2pm  mrc2pm.c  mrc.c


 Usage
 -----
 mrc2pm  <name>  >  <name>_grid.pm 


 Example
 -------
 mrc2pm  emd_1201.map  >  emd_1201_grid.pm

 reads in emd_1201.map file and outputs the PM gird file emd_1201_grid.pm 

 visualize emd_1201_grid.pm using Protein Mechanica script d1.

 #-------------------------------------------------------#

 This directory contains example scripts for Protein Mechanica.
 Each sub-directory contains scripts associated with a specific operation.   

 The data directory contains PDB files, PM surface files and PM
 grid files used by the example scripts.

 The following is a list of subdirectors:

 contact - contact potentials

 data - PDB, surface and grid files

 dna - reading and visualizing; simulatiing dna

 fit - fitting domains together

 forces - adding forces to simulations

 grid - visualizing volume grids from cryo-em; writing grid isosurface 

 helix_props - displaying helix properties (center line)

 hydrogen_bonds - displaying hydrogen bonds

 joints - creating joints

 macros - defining macros

 mass_springs - simulation of mass-spring systems

 mixed_models - simualtion of mixed (domain, surfaces, solids) multibody systems

 multibody - using the "multibody" command to simulate proteins on the peptide level

 restraints - using restraints

 rigid_simulation -  multibody systems simulations

 secondary_structure - visualizing secondary structure records in PDB 

 solids - creation of solids 

 springs - using elastic, bend and entrpic springs in multibody simulations,
           surface-surface springs, molecular domain - surface springs

 surfaces - visualization and simulation of surfaces as rigid bodies

 visualization - visualizing protein structures
